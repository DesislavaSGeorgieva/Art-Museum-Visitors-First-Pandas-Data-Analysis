# My-First-Pandas-Project
Jupyter Notebook for museum data analysis

# In this Jupyter Notebook I will demonstrate how to use the Pandas library to process and visualize data simulating visits to a museum. I will perform basic operations such as loading data from a CSV file, grouping and calculating averages, as well as visualizing the results.
