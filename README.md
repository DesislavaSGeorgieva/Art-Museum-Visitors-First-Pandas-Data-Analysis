# 🐼 First Pandas & Jupyter Notebook Demo

## 📌 Overview

This short project demonstrates basic use of **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** in a Jupyter Notebook. I used a small, simulated dataset representing visitor demographics to perform a few fundamental operations such as:

- Loading data from a '.csv' file
- Grouping by categorical values
- Calculating averages
- Visualizing results with a simple bar chart

The project is intended as a first step in showcasing my ability to use Python for data exploration and visualization.

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset contains sample information such as:

| Column      | Description                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 'Visitor_ID | Unique visitor identifier       |
| 'Age'       | Age of the visitor              |
| 'Gender'    | Gender (Male/Female/Other)      |
| 'Period'    | Example category for grouping   |

**Note:** Data is simulated for educational purposes.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 🧮 Pandas  
- 📊 Matplotlib  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook  
- 💻 Git & GitHub

## 📈 Result

A basic visualization (bar chart) shows the average age of visitors across different periods.

This helped me practice:
- Using 'groupby()' and '.mean()' in Pandas  
- Creating plots with 'matplotlib.pyplot' 
- Writing well-structured Jupyter Notebooks
